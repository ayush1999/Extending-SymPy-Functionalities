# Extending-SymPy-Functionalities
Making new and cool stuff using SymPy.

Hey There!
For those of you who don't know, SymPy is a Symbolic Computation Library:</br>
<a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy">SymPy- Github</a>

I'll be adding some new stuff that is currently not available in SymPy.
For this, I'll be using the SymPy package itself.</br>
P.S. Made using SymPy 1.1 </br>

(New Modules to be added Every week.)</br>
Some of the Modules maybe incomplete, indicating that there is work going on.</br>
Suggestions to improve code are welcome in the form of a Pull Request  !
